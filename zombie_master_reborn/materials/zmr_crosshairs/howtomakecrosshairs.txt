// Make your crosshair texture, 1024x1024, diffuse should be completely white, alpha channel has the actual crosshair.
// Export as tga in <gamefolder>/materialsrc/zmr_crosshairs (this is required, unfortunately)
// Make a .txt with the same name as the tga and paste the parameters below into it.
// Drag the tga onto bin/vtex.exe
// There is now a new vtf in materials/zmr_crosshairs with the same name.
// You'll have to copy one of the .vmts and tune edgesoftnessstart/edgesoftnessend
// Pro-tip: use 'mat_reloadmaterial zmr_crosshairs/name' for quick editing
